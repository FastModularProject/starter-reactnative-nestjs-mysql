**Step 1 : get the code** <br/>
git clone  

**Step 2 : prepare your environment** <br/>
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine.

**Step 3 : Launch docker** <br/>

**Step 7 : Launch the app** <br/>
```cd app``` and then <br/>
```npx react-native run-android``` or ```npx react-native run-ios```

**Install packages** <br/>
If you want to install a package with npm, you can npm install it locally. <br>
A watcher in the container is waiting for changes in your ```package.json``` and ```package-lock.json``` to replicate the installation you have done locally. <br/>
<br/>
If you are facing any issue, you can delete anoynmous container and force a rebuilt of your containers using : <br/>
`docker-compose up -V --build`

**Logs** <br/>
